        <br></br>
        <b>Food security</b> refers to the condition in which individuals, communities, and nations have consistent access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food 
        to meet their dietary needs and preferences for an active and healthy life. It encompasses several key dimensions, including food availability (ensuring an adequate supply of food), access (ensuring that people can obtain the food they need), utilization (ensuring that food 
        is properly utilized and provides necessary nutrients), and stability (ensuring that these conditions are sustained over time, even in the face of shocks or challenges). Food security is a fundamental human right and a cornerstone for societal well-being, economic growth, and overall development. 
        It extends beyond the absence of hunger and malnutrition to address the complex interplay of factors such as agricultural productivity, distribution systems, poverty alleviation, environmental sustainability, and resilience to shocks. Achieving global food security requires concerted efforts from governments, organizations, 
        and individuals to address the multifaceted challenges that can threaten the availability, access, and quality of food for all.
